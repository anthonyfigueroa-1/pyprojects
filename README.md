<h1>Simple python projects I have worked on to help me understand the fundamentals of python to build out automations for work.</h1>
<h3>
#1 is a simple calorie calculator, enter in how many calories you had for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and then enter in how much you calorie budget was for the day and the math will be done for you and will display whether you were above or below you calorie budget and by how much.<br><br>
#2 checks for the strength of a password and lets you know whether it is strong, medium, or weak. And bases it off of length and whether or not a number is contained within the password.<br><br>
#3 is an ATM and allows you to view your balance, deposit cash, or withdraw cash from the ATM.<br><br>
#4 is a task app which displays all tasks you have entered and allows for adding or removal of tasks.<br><br>
#5 is an upgraded version of the task app that allows for saving to tasks.txt when exiting the program correctly.<br><br>
#6 is is a contact book that allows for adding, removing, updating, and viewing of contacts. This one helped me with learning on how to search for users, in a list of a list, in a case unsensitive manner. This one also builds on saving contacts in memory to a text file and reading from a text file.<br><br>
#7 is a site outage app that allows for adding, removing, viewing and as well as generating out of office and text to speech txt files to allow for reading or uploading to status page that auto updates ooo and text to speech welcome message on helpdesk phone number when a user attempts to make a ticket using either method.<br><br>
